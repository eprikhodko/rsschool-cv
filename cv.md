About me:

In 2021 I learned frontend development at Scrimba. During my learning jorney I discovered the world of web development and learned about modern ways to make a quality website that is easy to maintain and develop.

My goal now is to find a cool team and get good experience. I'd like to grow into a good, aspiring middle developer in a year.

Interests: amateur photography on a small Fuji, hiking in the city.
